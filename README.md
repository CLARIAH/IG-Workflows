# CLARIAH Interest Group on Text

This repository is intended to organize the work, output and documentation of the CLARIAH Interest Group (IG) on
Workflows.

## Introduction

WP2 works to facilitate modular distributed workflows that bring together components
developed within and outside of CLARIAH to facilitate the different steps of research
processes. Workflows used in WP3, WP4, WP5 and WP6 contain potential
components at all levels. This Interest Group has a strong connection to IG 1
(DevOps), which focuses on toolchains that support workflows.

## Aims of the Interest Group

The aims of the IG on Workflows are:

- foster discussion and knowledge sharing regarding research workflows/pipelines
- develop and share best practices for setting up workflows, recommend solutions
- identify what kind of connections between tools the research community needs
